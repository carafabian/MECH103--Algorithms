# Button Arduino
This code is programmed to work when there are three buttons connected to an Arduino Board and each button has it's own LED light connected to it.

Whenever a button was pushed down a noise at a frequency specific to the button would play, the button's LED light would flash 5 times (at about 4 flashes/second), and then the light would stay lit after it flashed and the sound will continue to play until the button was no longer being pushed down.

* The frequency of the red button was 330 Hz, the blue button's frequency was 220 Hz, and the yellow button's frequency was 440 Hz.
